            <br />
            <p>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ALL ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND SYSTEMS MAY BE HOUSED ON SERVERS IN THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INFORMATION WE COLLECT (INCLUDING COOKIES) ARE PROCESSED AND STORED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MAY NOT OFFER THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTION AS THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU RESIDE OR ARE A CITIZEN. BY USING THE SERVICES AND PROVIDING INFORMATION TO US, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSFER TO AND PROCESSING OF THE INFORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
            <br />
            <p>What information do we collect?</p>
            <p>Information Provided by Users</p>
            <p>Your Account information: You provide your email, or log in for a third-party account (like Facebook), to create an online or application account (“Account”) or subscribe to our communications. If you refuse to provide such information, you may not be able to use the Services properly. When creating your Account, you may be asked to enter certain information, such as: your name, avatar, age, gender, address, telephone number and email address.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Payment information; Third-Party Payment Processor: We use a third-party payment processor (currently Paypal) to assist in securely processing your personally identifiable payment information. When you place an order through the Services, the credit card information that you provide is encrypted and transmitted directly to Paypal. We do not store your credit card information and do not control and are not responsible for Paypal or its collection or use of your information. You may find out more about how Paypal stores and uses your credit card information by accessing Paypal’s privacy policy.</p>
            <p>Customer Support: When you contact us, you can provide us with information about your use of the Services, including information about the Anker electronics and/or consumer products (“Products”) that you own and contact details, so that we can provide customer support. For example, you can send an email to Customer Support that contains information about our Roav Dash Cam performance, and other issues.</p>
            <p>Your voice: When you use one of our voice assisted technology supported Products, like eufy Genie and Soundcore Model Zero+, with your permission, your voice will be acquired by that Product and then transferred by that Product back to your elected third-party account (“Third-Party Account”) service as a command, such an Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant command, and relay you the requested information.</p>
            <p>Product Usage Information</p>
            <p>Product monitoring: We collect information about how you set up and use our Products, such as: functions used; operations performed; time, frequency, and duration of your activities within the Services, and any unique identifiers associated with your Product. For example, we collect the time period you connected the Product to the Application and the time of the last connection, as well as what operations you used in the Account, settings, and other functions in our Products.</p>
            <p>Services utilization: We collect information that our Products store and report as a part of the Services, such as: when you use eufyLife's Body Sense Smart Scale, your weight, temperature, blood pressure, body mass index, and other health indicators. Also, when you schedule the use of our Products, such as eufy RoboVac, we will save your settings.</p>
            <p>Images and biometric information: If you choose to enable imaging and biometric features in our Products, like the Roav Dash Cam and the eufy Evercam, we will collect and process certain information collected from our Products, such as face images and underlying face prints. This information enables your Product to recognize familiar faces and to notify you of familiar and unknown people. These features may also allow you to utilize the Services to create and save video or photographic images of individuals. Depending on where you live and how you configure the Products and Services, you may need to get explicit consent before using our Products to create and save video or photographic images and/or scan and match the faces of people.</p>
            <p>Device and Other Automatically Collected Information</p>
            <p>Device properties and operations: We collect certain information from and about your smartphone, tablet, or personal computer (“Device”), such as: Device number, model, hardware and software version, signal intensity, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and other information. We also collect information about the operations you perform on the Device, such as time, frequency, and duration of use.</p>
            <p>Device signals: We collect information that your Device sends out or receives to tailor the Services to our users in different regions, such as: geo-location, IP addresses, and external hardware information from your Device about surrounding Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers. You can enable and disable communicating such information to us by adjusting your Device security and privacy settings.</p>
            <p>Server logs: A server log is a list of the activities that a server performs. Anker’s servers automatically collect and store in server logs certain information, such as: your search queries, IP addresses, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, referral URL, and certain cookies that identify your browser or Account.</p>
            <p>Web beacons: A web beacon (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF) is computer code that communicates information from your Device to a server. Some of Anker’s Services and communications may contain embedded web beacons that allow a server to read certain types of information from your Device, such as: the number of people who have viewed certain content, when you opened an email message, and your Device IP address. Web beacons help Anker develop statistical information to provide better and more personalized content.</p>
            <p>Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about Device, such as: user settings, browsing history, and activities conducted while using the Services.	Anker Innovations Privacy Policy</p>
