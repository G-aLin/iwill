            <p>Back to School is here! Every year I put together a homework station on the side of our fridge and I have a new one for this school year. I love this location because my kids do their homework on our kitchen island. Everything they need is just right there. This is such an easy and convenient way to keep all of our school supplies organized and handy! Take a look!</p>
